# practice_analysis
For Lung Cancer Analysis,
I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/lung-cancer-detection) kaggle dataset to practice manipulating data in SAS and creating ods graphics.

For practicing Last Observation Carried Forward(LOCF) I created my own dataset using the datalines technique.
For practicing transposing using arrays with no missing values I used SAS help built in dataset "Tourism".
